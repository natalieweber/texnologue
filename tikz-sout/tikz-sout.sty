%%% Strikeout text with TikZ.
%%%
%%% Some strike out (or strikethrough) macros that use TikZ. These are
%%% more configurable than the macros provided by the ulem and soul
%%% packages. The idea is to provide a general macro for strikethrough
%%% of arbitrary text, then some macros that do specific flavours of
%%% strikethrough (double-lines, diagonal, etc.).
%%%
%%% The cancel package does a good job of simple strikeout text but
%%% it's not configurable enough. TikZ provides maximal configurability,
%%% but of course it requires all of TikZ to do it. Users should only use
%%% this if they already need TikZ, or if they don't mind it being loaded.
%%%
%%% TO DO:
%%% - fixed height
%%%   - edges are at middle height which changes depending on text
%%%   - may be solved with just a strut in the text node
%%%     - the strut should be user-specifiable
%%% - global height (yshift) adjustment
%%%   - fixed height is calculated, then a global increase or decrease
%%%   - this applies to both edge nodes, not just one
%%% - shorthand nwse and swne for angled strikeouts
%%%   - empirically determine some good yshifts
%%% - support for dash patterns and phases
%%%   - also support dash pattern styles ("densely dash dot", etc.)
%%% - double strikeouts using two lines above and below edge nodes
%%%   - two parallel lines equidistant from edge nodes
%%%   - can't use TikZ [double lines] because they are opaque
%%% - line decoration using decorations library
%%% - slashouts and ex-outs
%%%   - probably best done using decorations
